# HackHoot

## Summary

This project is a knock off of Kahoot, a popular app that allows players to take timed quizzes competing against each other.

We used this project to teach ZotHacks hackers the ins and outs of full stack development in our frontend and backend workshop.

This is the fully built project plus some minor changes to be able to run this on docker! You can look [here](https://github.com/takrishn/hackhoot-frontend) for the frontend template and [here](https://github.com/zpinto/hackhoot-backend) for the backend template.

## How to run

Local testing:
Use docker-compose to deploy the services on docker engine

or

Production:
Use docker swarm to deploy the stack across a cluster

```
